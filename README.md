# Unlocking the Mind: Decoding Motor Intentions for Brain-Computer Interfaces

## Abstract
Brain activity can be decoded to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) devices, enabling non-muscular communication with control systems for individuals with disabilities. In this project, we utilized deep learning models to predict cursor coordinates on a screen using electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals. ECoG recordings were collected from 5 subjects as they manipulated a joystick to trace a target circle on a screen, within recording windows ranging from 12 to 36 minutes (G. Schalk et al., 2007; G. Schalk et al., 2008). Our deep learning models demonstrated varying accuracies in predicting cursor locations, with the recurrent neural network achieving 54%, compared to the convolutional neural network at 1%. We aim to enhance predictive performance by refining model architectures, incorporating Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and exploring attention-based frameworks.
